Badges
======

This file is intended to be a master list of badges
for the current iteration of the Fedora Badges project.
Please submit new badge ideas in the form of a pull request
or an email to oddshocks at riseup dot net.

The badges *as they are actually deployed in Fedora Infrastructure* can be
found `here <http://infrastructure.fedoraproject.org/infra/ansible/roles/badges-backend/files/badges/>`_
in our ansible repo.

A note on numbers
-----------------

The values given for certain badges (ex. "close 50 bugs") are tentative
and were picked based on inital brainstorms by various folks. These
numbers will almost certainly change before we get into production
with badges. For many things, I think the following ranking system
will work (numbers should be scaled based on difficulty of
task).

-   Badge level I: 10 or 20 things

-   Badge level II: 20 or 50 things

-   Badge level III: 50 or 150 things

-   Badge level IV: 100 or 300 things

-   Badge level V: 250, 500, or 1000 things

Distro
------

These badges are awarded by the Fedora Project. They should be
automatically awarded by a rules engine that responds to
events on the fedmsg bus.
